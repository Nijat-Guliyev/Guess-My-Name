Game | GMN

## Introduction

This is a brief introduction to my project. It explains what the project is about. There are numbers from 1 to 20. You have 20 chances to find the right number in it. If you can't find it, you will see the text on the screen because you lost the game, and if you find it, you will see the printout because you found it right. The issue is that when you type a high number, you will see the text "Too high" in the right corner of the screen, and when you write a lower number, you will see "Too low". If you click the button without typing anything, a message will appear that there is no such number.

## Features
